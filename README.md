# Trusted Review Platform

Through creating and implementing the first Blockchain-based platform for trusted dental treatment reviews, 
Dentacoin Foundation will allow patients to raise their voice. 
Simultaneously, dentists will have access to up-to-date, extremely valuable market research data
and qualified patient feedback - the most powerful tool to improve service quality and to establish a loyal patient base.
Through a self- executing Smart Contract, the Dentacoin review platform will assure optimal autonomy, trust, speed and safety.
No manipulations are possible.

The brand new, blockchain-based feedback system (smart contract) will trigger a dynamic momentum for the opening
of DCN wallets in patients and dentists.

There will be a Dentacoin community that will create the prerequisites for the further steps of global market penetration
and will provide valuable market research results.

At this moment the developer team is working on the frontend, the address database and the smart contract.
Even before the ICO in October this platform is already presented in the market.
After the ICO begins the market offensive strategies and the advertising campaign for the global expansion will be implemented. 
This will create a rapid growing community of patients and dentists.
